<h2> About this project: </h2>

This exploratory data analysis is my project for the [Inferential Statistics with R Course at Platzi](https://platzi.com/clases/estadistica-inferencial/)

As well, this is one of the challenges for Platzi Master -- an education acceleration program to form the future tech leaders in LATAM.

<h2> Brief description: </h2>

The goal of this project is to implement an statistical model which can analyze the performance of a group of students. For this purpose, the model also evaluates socioeconomic variables. The final outcome is a result visualization.
